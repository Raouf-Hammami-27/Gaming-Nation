# Gaming-Nation v1.0
In order to help amateurs or gamers, a much powerful way to discover, get informed for new games, and follow events and tournaments through a new software platform. A project developed by the group “The Fighters” as part of Integrated Project Module within **ESPRIT**. Our project named **Gaming Nation** that will create a suitable platform to amateurs or gamers. The objective of our project is to bring together fans of video games, mentor and encourage them to invest more in their talents, giving them the chance to compete in tournaments and to be apart of a big community. We've developed Rest Api services based on **Java Enterprise Edition** and **Asp.Net** in order to use them in the mobile application developed with **Ionic** Framework and the the front end part developed with #AngularJs. As well the project contains an administrator portal developed in **Asp.Net** that allows the management and reporting tasks of the website.
